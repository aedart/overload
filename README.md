## Overload ##

Provides means to dynamically deal with inaccessible properties, by implementing PHP’s magic methods;
__get(), __set(), __isset(), and __unset(). This package, however, enforces the usage of getters- and setters-methods, ensuring that if a property
is indeed available, then its corresponding getter or setter method will be invoked. The term 'overload', in this context, refers to PHP’s own definition hereof. (http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php)
